# SupportTool

#NOTE: As of 01/28/2019, hosts will now be in the file *st_links.txt* <- Please add new links to this file

#This repo contains the *"st_links.txt"* file host which can be edited

#Ensure that the files are uploaded to DROPBOX only

#Ensure that the entries in the st_links.txt file follow the format: Environment,File Name,link

#When pasting links change the "?dl=0" to "?dl=1" at the end of the link. Otherwise the download will NOT work in the SupportTool app

#The level2.txt file contains Level 2 builds only, and the misclist contains Misc files/tools only. Editing these files follow the same 
#rules as the "st_links.txt" file 

#Highly recommend adding a comment when committing a change to any file. Not necessary but it helps keep track of things
