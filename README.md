#This repo contains the _"_links.txt"_ file host which can be edited.

#Ensure that the files are uploaded to DROPBOX only.

#Ensure that the entries in the links.txt file follow the format: Environment,File Name,link

#When pasting links change the "?dl=0" to "?dl=1" at the end of the link. Otherwise the download will NOT work in the SupportTool app.

#Highly recommend adding a comment when committing a change to the links.txt file. Not necessary but it helps keep track of things.
